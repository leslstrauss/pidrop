# Step 4

**Copy swap files to newly detected non-admin disks.**

In the previous step we copied files from the admin folder to a swap directory. Now we want to do the opposite for non-admin users. If the USB stick does not contain the admin folder, copy the contents of the swap folder to a folder on the new disk named "pidrop-user." We already have all the tools necessary from the last step to accomplish this. In this case, we do not want to empty the "pidrop-user" directory before copying the swap to it.
